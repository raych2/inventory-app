# Inventory App
This database-driven inventory app was created for a fake store called _TOP General Store_.  Users can modify the store's inventory by viewing, adding, updating, or deleting items, vendors, and categories.  The project guidelines are listed in [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/paths/full-stack-javascript/courses/nodejs/lessons/inventory-application) Node.js curriculum.

## Purpose
The purpose of this project is to design an app that implements MVC (Model View Controller) architecture and CRUD (Create Read Update Delete) methods.  I gained more familiarity using a NoSQL database (MongoDB), templating engines (Pug), and Express middleware (i.e. express-validator and multer).

## Technologies Used
* CSS, JavaScript
* [Pug](https://pugjs.org/api/getting-started.html)
* [MongoDB Atlas](https://www.mongodb.com/cloud/atlas)
* [Express](https://expressjs.com/)
* [Heroku](https://www.heroku.com/)
